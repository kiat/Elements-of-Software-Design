## General Study Guide for Course Elements of Software Design CS313e

### Preparation for Class
* Read the notes posted online for the day.
* Read the relevant sections in the book. Each day's reading is given in the schedule.
* You do not have to understand everything that you read. Make a list of questions. ASK in class!

### Follow Up After Class
* Try out a few of the programming exercises in [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), or [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/).
* If you have problems, visit the TAs during office hours. Sign up and we will help you with your program.
* If you are not programming, you are not studying.
* Your study time will be approximately 10 hours per week. Schedule your time accordingly.
